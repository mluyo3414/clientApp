DESCRIPTION:
=============

Client app for the FoodNow project is designed to send orders from an android device to a server for any restaurant. For now we have it catered to Qdoba on campus which serves approximately 13,000 orders per day. In this client application there is a settings activity and three tabs (Menu, Main and Order). The settings include a name, phone number and payment method (pay at pick up or PayPal). The menu displays all of the possible combinations. The main menu displays the number of people in the queue before ordering (hhtpGet)QdobaÂ® burrito menu and the hours of the restaurant. The order tab allows you to send the order, this will use either PayPal or pickup when ordering. Upon a successful order a confirmation number is sent to the client from the server.
